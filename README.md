## My Hobby Projects

Most of my time I spend on my own projects. I mainly focus on [godot-solana-sdk](https://github.com/Virus-Axel/godot-solana-sdk)

### ü§ñ Godot Solana SDK

Starting in early 2022 I worked on a blockchain game project that evolved into a game engine plugin. Godot Solana SDK was originally written in rust, but was rewritten as a C++ Godot GDExtension. It is actively maintained here on Github. Project is thankfully backed by grants from Metaplex and the Solana Foundation.

TODO(Virax): Add all my projects here. Send me a mail if you want to know more [axel.benjaminsson@live.se](mailto:axel.benjaminsson@live.se)

## My Work Experience

I have several years of professional C and C++ experience. I have mostly developed embedded software for cars and technical equipment. I have worked as a consultant at several companies. The following sections describe my work experience and what my duties were.

### üöó Volvo Cars Corporation 

I have been developing C and C++ for their software platform. I wrote software to manage different low-voltage functionality in the cars with AUTOSAR adaptive. I also worked with locking and alarm functionality. I worked on setting up and developing alarm software from scratch using AUTOSAR classic. Software I worked on here was written in both C and C++.

### ü©ª Raysafe
For a short period I worked with software for an electrical measurement device. Software was written in C and my responsibilities were to develop new features maintain existing ones.

### üëÅÔ∏è SmartEye 
At SmartEye I worked on a software library for special cameras. The cameras were used to capture data from a vehicle driver to make predictions on. The algorithms were written in C++ and my responsibilities were to develop and improve the software prediction algorithms.
